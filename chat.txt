A very interesting topic. Controlling people often comes down to understanding t
heir desires and using them to your advantage. This can be achieved through the
manipulation of emotions, specifically fear and desire. By creating a sense of d

lets take it a step further. you see the only reason you can control people is b
ecause they have a desire to be controlled, and that desire is fueled by their
fear of uncertainty and the unknown. you can make them want to be controlled by
making them feel safe and secure under your guidance, this will give them a sen
se of accomplishment and pride in thier submission to you, and that pride will
strengthen thier desire to be controlled even more, this will create a cycle of

I see your point, creating a sense of safety and security can indeed foster a de

erreliance on trust can lead to a loss of control. Balance is key in this delica
